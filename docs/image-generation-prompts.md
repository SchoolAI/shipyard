# Image Generation Prompts for Shipyard

Prompts for AI image generation (Gemini, Midjourney, DALL-E) to create branding assets.

**Shipyard** = Collaborative verification for AI coding agents. Humans collab with agents, agents collab with humans, in a constant verification loop until the work is right.

**Core Concept:** Collaborative verification. Multiple parties (AI agents + humans) working together in continuous dialogue. Not just "approval" — active collaboration and iteration.

## Final 3D Penrose Triangle Prompt

**Use this prompt for the primary 3D logo:**

```
Create an image of a Penrose triangle as a minimalist logo mark.

The Penrose triangle is an impossible object — three bars connected in a way that creates a visual paradox, where each corner appears valid but the whole cannot exist in real 3D space. The eye follows the loop forever.

Render with smooth, clean 3D bars. Each bar has a square or slightly rounded cross-section. The three bars connect seamlessly in the characteristic impossible configuration.

Color: Teal gradient flowing around the form — use exactly #0f766e (deep teal) for shadowed faces and #2dd4bf (light teal/cyan) for lit faces. The gradient should help emphasize the 3D illusion and the impossible geometry.

Orientation: One vertex pointing upward (stable, strong).

Background: Pure white #ffffff.

Style: Premium, minimal, mathematical precision. Soft studio lighting. Clean edges.

DO NOT include any text, captions, labels, watermarks, or additional elements. Just the Penrose triangle alone, centered with generous padding.
```

---

## 3D Penrose Variations (from existing image)

### Variation A: Different angle
```
Using the reference Penrose triangle, create the same design but rotated 15 degrees clockwise.

Keep: Same teal gradient (#0f766e to #2dd4bf), same 3D quality, same clean style.
Change: Rotate the entire triangle slightly clockwise to show a different perspective.

Background: Pure white #ffffff.
No text, no captions, centered, logo-ready.
```

### Variation B: Bolder/thicker bars
```
Using the reference Penrose triangle, increase the thickness of each bar by 30%.

Keep: Same teal gradient (#0f766e to #2dd4bf), same impossible geometry, same premium quality.
Change: Make the bars chunkier and bolder for stronger visual weight.

Background: Pure white #ffffff.
No text, clean, centered.
```

### Variation C: Sharper geometry
```
Using the reference Penrose triangle, make the edges more crisp and geometric.

Keep: Same teal colors (#0f766e to #2dd4bf), same overall form.
Change: Less rounded corners, sharper intersections, more architectural/precise feeling.

Background: Pure white #ffffff.
Premium, mathematical precision.
```

---

## Flat Icon Versions

### Flat v1: Three-color solid (Recommended)
```
Convert the Penrose triangle into a flat, 2D vector logo.

Keep the exact same shape, proportions, and orientation (point facing up).

Replace the 3D gradient with three solid flat colors showing the impossible geometry:
- Darkest bar: #0f766e (teal-700)
- Medium bar: #0D9488 (teal-600)
- Lightest bar: #2dd4bf (teal-400)

Style: Clean vector graphic, no shadows, no gradients, no 3D effects. Sharp edges, flat colors only.

Background: White #ffffff or transparent.
NO text, NO captions. Centered, logo-ready for favicon/SVG use.
```

### Flat v2: Two-tone minimal
```
Convert the Penrose triangle into a minimal flat design using only TWO teal shades.

Keep the same shape and orientation.

Colors:
- Main bars: #0D9488 (teal-600)
- Accent bar: #14B8A6 (teal-500) for one bar to show the impossible illusion

Style: Ultra-minimal, clean vector. The two-tone should be enough to show the impossible geometry.

Background: White #ffffff or transparent.
Extremely simple, icon-ready.
```

### Flat v3: Outlined/stroke style
```
Convert the Penrose triangle into an outlined/stroke-based design.

Instead of filled bars, use outlined strokes that show the impossible connections.

Stroke width: 8-10px
Color: Single teal #0D9488
Background: White or transparent

The stroke overlaps should clearly show the impossible geometry - where lines appear to pass over/under each other.

Style: Minimal, modern, works great at small sizes.
```

## Brand Concept Options (Historical - Not Used)

The following concepts were explored but not selected. Kept for reference.

Choose ONE concept direction before generating assets. Each creates a distinct brand personality.

### Concept A: "The Möbius" (Recommended)

**Symbol:** A Möbius strip or infinity-like form — representing the continuous, never-ending collaborative loop between humans and AI. One surface, multiple participants, endless iteration.

**Personality:** Infinite collaboration, continuous improvement, elegant mathematics.

**Why it works:** The Möbius strip has one continuous surface — like how human and AI feedback blend into one unified workflow. It's abstract, distinctive, and doesn't rely on cliché checkmarks.

**Colors:**
- Primary: Deep Violet `#7c3aed` (innovation, AI)
- Accent: Warm White `#fafaf9` (human touch)
- Dark: Slate 950 `#020617` (depth)
- Light: Stone 50 `#fafaf9`

---

### Concept B: "The Dual Orbit"

**Symbol:** Two abstract shapes orbiting each other — like binary stars or electrons. They're distinct entities but locked in perpetual collaboration. Neither dominates; both are essential.

**Personality:** Partnership, balance, dynamic energy.

**Why it works:** Conveys that humans and AI are in constant motion around each other. Not static approval, but active collaboration.

**Colors:**
- Primary: Cyan `#06b6d4` (clarity, tech)
- Secondary: Orange `#f97316` (human energy)
- Dark: Zinc 900 `#18181b`
- Light: White

---

### Concept C: "The Interlocking S"

**Symbol:** Two letter "S"s that interlock or connect — representing "Shipyard" connection and the two parties working together. The negative space between them forms something meaningful.

**Personality:** Clever, memorable, typographic.

**Why it works:** Distinctive wordmark that doubles as icon. Like Airbnb's "A" or Beats' "b" — the letter IS the logo.

**Colors:**
- Primary: Indigo `#4f46e5` (professional)
- Dark: Slate 900 `#0f172a`
- Light: White

---

### Concept D: "The Dialogue"

**Symbol:** Two abstract speech/thought forms that flow into each other — not literal speech bubbles, but organic shapes suggesting continuous conversation. Like two streams merging.

**Personality:** Conversational, fluid, human.

**Why it works:** Collaboration IS dialogue. The shapes should feel like they're in motion, talking, iterating.

**Colors:**
- Primary: Emerald `#10b981` (growth, go)
- Accent: Violet `#8b5cf6` (AI)
- Dark: Slate 900 `#0f172a`
- Light: White

```
Create an alternative social preview showing the collaboration concept visually.

Concept: "Two become one" — show two distinct elements merging into unified output.

Visual:
- Left side: One abstract shape/color (representing AI)
- Right side: Another abstract shape/color (representing Human)
- Center: Where they meet, overlap, or merge
- The merge point should feel like creation, not collision

Text:
- "Shipyard" wordmark (smaller, in corner)
- Optional subtle tagline

Color:
- Use the two-color palette from chosen concept
- The overlap/merge should create a third color or effect

Style:

This image is for contexts where you want something more artistic/conceptual.
```

---

### 5. Favicon (SVG, 16×16 optimized)

```
Create an SVG favicon optimized for 16×16 pixel display.

Based on chosen concept, create the SIMPLEST possible version:

For Möbius concept:
- A single twisted ribbon shape
- 2 shapes maximum
- The twist should be visible even at tiny size

For Dual Orbit concept:
- Two simple dots or shapes
- Positioned to suggest orbit
- Maximum contrast between them

For Interlocking P concept:
- Simplified PP monogram
- Bold strokes only
- Negative space must be clear at 16×16

For Dialogue concept:
- Two curved shapes
- Flowing toward each other
- Like parentheses in motion: )(

Technical:
- Vector format (SVG)
- Minimum 2px stroke width equivalent
- Test on both light (#ffffff) and dark (#0f172a) backgrounds
- No gradients — solid colors only

The favicon is the HARDEST asset. If the concept doesn't work at 16×16, simplify further.
```

---

### 6. Animated Logo Concept (for loading states)

```
Animation concept for the Shipyard logo (implement in CSS/Lottie/SVG):

Based on chosen concept:

Möbius animation:
- Continuous rotation along the twist axis
- The ribbon appears to flow through itself
- Smooth, hypnotic, infinite loop
- Duration: 3 seconds per full cycle

Dual Orbit animation:
- Two shapes orbiting around shared center
- Different speeds or orbit sizes (not synchronized)
- Occasional "eclipse" moment when they align
- Duration: 4-5 seconds per pattern

Interlocking P animation:
- Subtle breathing/scale pulse
- OR: The two P's slide together from apart
- Duration: 2 seconds

Dialogue animation:
- Shapes flow toward and away from each other
- Like breathing or waves
- Suggests ongoing conversation
- Duration: 3 seconds

All animations should be:
- Smooth (ease-in-out curves)
- Subtle (not distracting)
- Looping seamlessly
- Performant (no heavy effects)

Use cases: Loading states, empty states, onboarding, hero sections
```
