# Shipyard Rebirth: Loro + Tiptap Migration Plan

## Spike Validation ✅

**Status:** Technical validation complete (2026-02-01)
**Results:** All P0 and P1 criteria passed
**See:** [../../spikes/tiptap-loro/FINDINGS.md](../../spikes/tiptap-loro/FINDINGS.md) for comprehensive validation report

## Schema Design ✅

**Status:** Complete (2026-02-01)
**Location:** `spikes/loro-schema/src/shapes.ts` (536 lines)
**Key learnings documented below**

### Design Outcomes

**Two document types:**
1. **TaskDocumentSchema** - One per task (meta, content, comments, artifacts, deliverables, events, linkedPRs, inputRequests, changeSnapshots)
2. **RoomSchema** - One per room (taskIndex with denormalized task metadata for dashboard)

**Duplication eliminated via base schemas:**
- CommentBaseFields (7 fields × 4 variants)
- EventBaseFields (5 fields × 20 variants)
- ArtifactBaseFields (5 fields × 2 variants)
- InputRequestBaseFields (9 fields × 9 variants)
- **Total: ~260 lines of duplication eliminated**

**Architecture decisions:**
- Input requests live ONLY in TaskDocumentSchema (no taskId field - implicit from parent doc)
- RoomSchema has taskIndex with denormalized metadata (taskId, title, status, ownerId, hasPendingRequests, lastUpdated, createdAt)
- All identity fields (id, title, status) in meta struct (Loro doc constraint - can only contain containers at root)
- ChangeSnapshots fully typed using Shape.struct() (not JSON-stringified)
- Discriminated unions everywhere: comments by 'kind', events by 'type', artifacts by 'storage', inputRequests by 'type'
- Cross-document operations update both TaskDocument and RoomSchema.taskIndex atomically via shared helpers

### Key Technical Learnings

**1. Shape.plain.struct() vs Shape.struct()**
- `Shape.plain.struct()` → ValueShape (can only contain values)
- `Shape.struct()` → ContainerShape (can contain lists, records, counters, etc.)
- Use container version when nesting containers (e.g., ChangeSnapshot with files list)

**2. Loro doc constraints**
- Can only contain container types at root: list, record, struct, text, tree, counter
- Plain values (string, number, boolean) must be wrapped in a struct
- This is why meta is a struct, not individual fields

**3. Base schema patterns from loro-extended**
- Extract common fields as constants with `as const`
- Use spread operator (...) to compose into structs
- Create field constant objects for variant-specific fields
- Follows loro-extended examples: asks package, quiz-challenge, bumper-cars

**4. Comment philosophy**
- Field names + types should tell the story
- Only add JSDoc for non-obvious info: formats, constraints, relationships
- Remove all "EXISTS:", "UI:", "If removed:" commentary
- Result: 910 → 536 lines (41% reduction)

**5. Document isolation via loro-extended visibility**
- One WebRTC connection per room, multiple docs sync over it
- `visibility` permission controls which docs sync to which peers
- Document-level isolation (not sub-document encryption)
- Same task doc can sync over multiple meshes (Personal Room + Collab Room)
- No sub-document encryption needed

**6. Cross-document coordination**
- Operations update BOTH TaskDocument and RoomSchema.taskIndex atomically
- Shared helper pattern in `@shipyard/loro-schema`
- Example: `updateTaskStatus(taskDoc, roomDoc, newStatus)` updates both
- Ensures denormalized taskIndex stays consistent with source of truth

**7. ownerId nullability**
- Made non-nullable in both TaskDocumentSchema.meta and RoomSchema.taskIndex
- Tasks always have an owner (set at creation time)
- Simplifies permission checks

## Context

This is a **greenfield rebuild** based on production learnings, not a preservation migration. We validated that BlockNote-as-data-format was the wrong choice and are rebuilding with Loro + Tiptap.

**Key Insight:** BlockNote locked us into Y.XmlFragment as the storage format. Loro + Tiptap + loro-extended gives us full control over the data model.

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Current)
```
Data Format: BlockNote Block[] → Y.XmlFragment (BlockNote-controlled)
Sync: y-websocket + y-webrtc + y-indexeddb (manual orchestration)
Editor: BlockNote + Mantine
Server: Custom registry-server.ts with y-protocols
```

### After (Target)
```
Data Format: Loro-native (we control the schema)
Sync: loro-extended adapters (automatic coordination)
Editor: Tiptap + loro-prosemirror + HeroUI v3
Server: loro-extended/adapter-leveldb + adapter-websocket
```

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal:** Validate approach with spikes, design schema

**Tasks:**

**A. Design Work (First 2-3 days)** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-01)
1. Design Loro Shape ✅
   - ✅ Full schema: metadata, content, comments, events, inputRequests, changeSnapshots
   - ✅ Discriminated unions for polymorphic types (comments by 'kind', events by 'type', artifacts by 'storage', inputRequests by 'type')
   - ✅ Base schemas extracted to eliminate duplication (~346 lines saved)
   - ✅ Hybrid inputRequests architecture (global with taskId + per-task without)
   - ✅ Type-safe changeSnapshots using Shape.struct() for nested containers
   - **See:** `spikes/loro-schema/src/shapes.ts` (536 lines, down from 960 initial)
   - **Key learnings:**
     - Shape.plain.struct() = ValueShape (can't contain containers)
     - Shape.struct() = ContainerShape (can contain lists, records)
     - Use base field constants + spread for DRY discriminated unions
     - Loro docs can only contain containers at root (wrapped id/title/status in meta struct)

2. Research Edge URL limit
   - [ ] Verify 2K vs 2M character limit
   - [ ] Test actual behavior
   - [ ] Decide support or document limitation

**B. Spike Work (Next 2-3 days)** ✅ COMPLETE

```
Y.Doc {
  'document': Y.XmlFragment (BlockNote ProseMirror XML),
  'metadata': Y.Map,
  'threads': Y.Map (BlockNote threads),
  'artifacts': Y.Array,
  ...
}
```

### New (Loro-Controlled)
```
LoroDoc {
  structure: LoroTree,          # Block ordering/nesting
  blocks: LoroMap,              # blockId → content
  comments: LoroMap,            # commentId → Comment
  metadata: LoroStruct,         # Plan metadata
  artifacts: LoroList,
  deliverables: LoroList,
  events: LoroList,
  snapshots: LoroList
}
```

Using their architecture doc's one-doc-many-containers approach.

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Unknowns

1. **loro-extended maturity**
   - Is it production-ready?
   - SchoolAI built it - do you have internal examples?
   - Any known issues?

2. **loro-prosemirror completeness**
   - Does it support all Tiptap features?
   - Comment marks tested?
   - Undo/redo works?

3. **Signaling protocol compatibility**
   - Can loro WebRTC adapter use current signaling?
   - Need protocol changes?

### Rollback Plan

- None - this is a one-way door
- Old branch stays in git history if we need to reference
- No data migration (fresh start)

---

## Success Metrics

### Must Have (P0)
- [ ] Plan creation works
- [ ] Browser ↔ server sync works
- [ ] P2P sync works
- [ ] Editing works
- [ ] Persistence works (survives refresh)

### Should Have (P1)
- [ ] Comments work
- [ ] Version history works
- [ ] Agent spawning works
- [ ] Artifacts upload

### Nice to Have (P2)
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Multi-device sync
- [ ] URL sharing

---

## What We Learn

### Validated Assumptions
- ✅ loro-extended provides sync infrastructure
- ✅ Tiptap + loro-prosemirror integration exists
- ✅ Can control data format with Loro

### New Learnings
- BlockNote-as-format was wrong (learned by shipping)
- Need minimal editor features (drag + format + comments)
- loro-extended eliminates custom sync orchestration

### Architectural Wins
- Own the data format (not locked to BlockNote)
- Simpler sync (loro-extended > manual providers)
- Better types (Loro's API is cleaner)
- Less code (38% reduction in sync layer)

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Aggressive:** 4-5 weeks (if loro-extended works as advertised)
**Realistic:** 6-7 weeks (accounting for unknowns)
**Conservative:** 8-10 weeks (if we hit blockers)

Your intuition that it "won't take as long" suggests you have confidence in loro-extended. If it works well, the aggressive timeline is achievable.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate loro-extended** - Do you have internal examples/docs from SchoolAI?
2. **Create loro-schema package** - Start with Shape definitions
3. **Prototype editor** - Tiptap + loro-prosemirror spike
4. **Test sync** - loro-extended Repo with adapters

Want me to start with any of these?
