- When um looking at a like when focusing on the page or switching tasks, we want to figure out um some sort of hierarchy here for like the most important thing we should be looking at. So for example, uh the hierarchy is if there's like a permission request shown on the screen, we should focus there using the same focus rules. So we want to make sure that we are using like the again, there's like the delay from like switching tasks or sometimes there's immediate but there's like these focus rules of like w how long to focus on stuff. Um and then we just need to determine what to focus on after that like rule expires.

- he hotkey uh like labels show that it's uh command sorry, control S but in reality to actually get prompts to stash it's still Command S. I'm betting we're just missing a  
- Uh please we want to have a feature that lets us do uh the JNK task navigation with a three second delay before it autofocuses on the composer um or whatever the target priority um target is within the window. Uh kinda like Gmail, how it takes like two or three seconds before it reads an email. This allows you to toggle quickly between tasks without um interacting with them.
