# peer-plan

P2P collaborative review for AI-generated implementation plans.

The Penrose triangle logo represents the "impossible triangle" of AI development: quality, speed, and low effort. Traditionally you sacrifice one. Peer Plan enables all three through collaborative verification loops.

## What is this?

When an AI agent generates an implementation plan, peer-plan enables:
- **Real-time collaborative review** between humans and agents
- **Agent verifiability** through artifacts (screenshots, test results, recordings)
- **Zero infrastructure** — GitHub Pages + local MCP server, no paid services
