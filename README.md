# peer-plan

P2P collaborative review for AI-generated implementation plans.

## What is this?

When an AI agent generates an implementation plan, peer-plan enables:
- **Real-time collaborative review** between humans and agents
- **Agent verifiability** through artifacts (screenshots, test results, recordings)
- **Zero infrastructure** — GitHub Pages + local MCP server, no paid services

## Documentation

- **[docs/](./docs/)** — Architecture, milestones, systems inventory
- **[docs/original-vision/](./docs/original-vision/)** — Original design docs (historical)
